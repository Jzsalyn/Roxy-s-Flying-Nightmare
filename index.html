<h2> Description: I designed a game suitable for 12 year olds and up. The player will be playing as Roxy an emo bird. Roxy is sent into a different dimension after doing a summoning ritual. Roxy soon recognizes that she's stuck forever in the dimension. Everyday Roxy faces the same blue pipe nightmare that will never end. The player will jump through and over the blue pipes that pass through the dimension. In the game players will:
   <ul> 
      
       <li> Play as Roxy a flying emo bird </li>
       <li> Earn points as the player passes through the upcoming obstacles</li>
       <li> Players will be able to keep playing the game in order to beat their previous score</li> </ul>

     <h2> Design and Production Process:</h2>
<ul> <li> Brainstormed different ideas</li>
<li>  Made a plan to keep it simple </li> 
    <li> Made a lovable character</li>
    <li> Made a score box to keep track of what the player earned from playing the game</li>
    <li> Added music to keep the game from being stale</li>
</ul>
<h2> Reflection :</h2>
<ul>  <li> One thing I learned: is how to make the character jump </li>
</ul>

    <ul><li> One thing I would do differently: is learn how to make it where the player can choose their own character and customization</li>
</ul>
